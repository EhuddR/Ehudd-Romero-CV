## Interests
---
I'm a person who is very good at working in a team or on my own.
I'm writing my own research about racism in Ecuador, its continuities and ruptures within Ecuadorian modernity.
I am passionate about data analysis as well as theories about culture and our society.
I consider myself an avid reader. I have just read Erich Fromm's book The Art of Loving and I must say that it allowed me
to understand a lot about interpersonal relationships and how they are reproduced.
